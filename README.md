# odin-recipes

This project consisted of creating a recipe website.  An initial home page was created to serve as directory to a list of recipe pages.  The home page made use of the <a href=""> function and the <ul> function.  The recipe pages used the <img src="" alt=""> function and also used <ul> and <ol> functions.  Headings were then used in order of importance to create headings for the page itself and for the lists within the page.
